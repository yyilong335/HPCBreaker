# Covert Channel

In this directory, there are three covert channel: ff, fr, and pp. These files use workshop template in UVA CS 6354 course by Prof. Ashish Venkat, Logan, and Conner.

The two txt files are used as input and output.

To compile, just need to run the makefile.

All these covert channels can recover information with very high correct rate.
